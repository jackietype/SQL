1. How many orders were placed in January?

Select count(*) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

select count(product) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where product = 'iPhone'
and length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

select distinct acctnum from BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
on cust.order_id = FEB.orderID
where length(cust.order_id)=6
and length(feb.orderID)=6;

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?  

SELECT jansales.Product, jansales.price from BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT(1);

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT product, sum(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product, price;

Another way 

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product; 

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

select count(distinct accnum),
avg(quantity*price) from BIT_DB.FebSales as FEB

where FEB.Quantity>2
and length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';
