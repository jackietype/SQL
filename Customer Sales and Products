In this SQL, I am selecting and filtering data from multiple tables to gather statistics about customers and order data

1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

2. How many orders in January were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

3. Select customer account numbers from orders placed in February:
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

4. What was the cheapest product sold in January and how much did it cost? 
SELECT product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

5. Find the total revenue for each product sold in January:
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

6. Which products were sold in February using the address 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many were sold and what is the total revenue?
SELECT sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

7. How many customers ordered 2 or more products at a time and what was the average amount spent from those customers? 
sELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
