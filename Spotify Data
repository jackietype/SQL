# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# I created a table to insert Spotify data into and performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# I created a table with the Spotify Data .csv 

# Then, I inquired on which artists had the most popularity and limited the search results to 10. 
Select max(spotifydata.popularity), spotifydata.artist_name from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

# I checked which artists had the shortest songs
SELECT spotifydata.artist_name as Artist, min(spotifydata.duration_ms) as Shortest_Song, spotifydata.track_name
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY duration_ms asc
LIMIT 10;

# I determined which song had the average danceablity and energy from the list
select avg(spotifydata.danceability) as dancebility, spotifydata.energy as energy, spotifydata.track_name
from bit_db.Spotifydata;

# I checked how many songs the artist Dua Lipa had on the list
select spotifydata.artist_name, spotifydata.track_name 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Dua Lipa';
